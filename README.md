Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Ubuntu Phablet Android build, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the Ubuntu Phablet trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u repo init -u git://github.com/utopykzebulon/android.git

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the (http://wiki.ubuntu.com/) for building instructions.
